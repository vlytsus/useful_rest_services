# Useful API in Swagger or WADL

This repo contains some useful rest services descriptors in popular Swagger or WADL formats.
Sometime you need WADL buth there is only Swagger YAML presented. So I'll keep here converted API versions.

* WADL for smsportal.com V1 API:  [MyMobileAPI_smsportal_REST_V1.wadl](https://github.com/vlytsus/useful_rest_services/blob/master/MyMobileAPI_smsportal_REST_V1.wadl)
