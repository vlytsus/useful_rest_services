# Useful Tools That Are Too Small To Be a Project

This repo contains some useful rest services descriptors in popular Swagger or WADL formats.
Sometime you need WADL buth there is only Swagger YAML presented. So I'll keep here converted API versions.

* WADL for smsportal.com V1 API:  [MyMobileAPI_smsportal_REST_V1.wadl](https://github.com/vlytsus/useful_rest_services/blob/master/MyMobileAPI_smsportal_REST_V1.wadl)

* XSLT template to present struts xml in human readable format: [struts_2_xml_mapping.xslt] (https://github.com/vlytsus/useful_rest_services/blob/master/struts_2_xml_mapping.xslt)
